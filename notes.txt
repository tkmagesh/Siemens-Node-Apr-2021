REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop

CommonJS
    Everything defined in a js file is considered private
    If anything need to be exposed to the outside world, it has to be explicitly exported
        module.exports = /* entity to be exported */
        The default value of module.exports is an empty object

    To use an entity from another file, it has to explicitly imported
        var <variable> = require('....js')

Modularity assignment
Create the following files as given below:

    accmulator.js
        //implement the accumulator based on the usage in the accmulator-client.js


    accmulator-client.js
        import accmulator
        acc.add(100)
        acc.subtract(50)
        acc.multiply(10)
        acc.divide(2)
        console.log(acc.getResult())  //=> ((100-50)*10)/2 => 250
