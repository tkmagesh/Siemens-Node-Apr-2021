CommonJS
    Everything defined in a js file is considered private
    If anything need to be exposed to the outside world, it has to be explicitly exported
        module.exports = /* entity to be exported */
        The default value of module.exports is an empty object

    To use an entity from another file, it has to explicitly imported
        var <variable> = require('....js')
